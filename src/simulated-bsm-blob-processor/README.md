# Simulated BSM Blob Processor
In the MMITSS simulation environment, simulated vehicles using the [MMITSS Driver Model](./../driver-model) pack their dynamic state information in a BLOB and send the BLOB to a configured network client. The structure of the BLOB is defined [here](./../README.md). Simulated-Bsm-Blob-Processor is a client that unpacks these BLOBs and constructs the corresponding JSON strings with `MsgType="BSM"`. These JSON strings are forwarded to the [Message-Distributor](./../../server/message-distributor) for further processing and distribution. 

## Console output and logging
Simulated-Bsm-Blob-Processor neither produces any console output nor generates any log file

## Requirements
1. Python package: [bitstring](https://pypi.org/project/bitstring/)
2. The simulation Driver Model must be configured to send the generated blobs to above IPv4 address and the UDP port.  

## Configuration
Following fields in the `/nojournal/bin/mmitss-phase3-master-config.json` file are used by the Simulated-Bsm-Blob-Processor:
1. `["HostIp"]`: a `string` specifying the IPv4 address of the host machine or the host container.
2. `["PortNumber"]["SimulatedBsmBlobProcessor"]`: an `int` specifying the UDP port to be used.

## Known issues/limitations
Any changes in the structure of the BLOB generated by the driver model will break the outputs generated by the Simulated-Bsm-Blob-Processor. In such cases, the source code of the Simulated-Bsm-Blob-Processor needs to be updated to be able to read the new structure of the BLOB.
