# bin

This directory is a warehouse of binary files. In this directory, for each component of MMITSS a subdirectory is available. Each component subdirectory contains two subdirectories: one for storing binaries built under ARM architecture and another for storing binaries built under x86 architecture.

Overall heirarchy under this directory is as follows:

- bin
    - ComponentA
        - arm
        - x86
    - ...
    - ...
    - ComponentZ
        - arm
        - x86
